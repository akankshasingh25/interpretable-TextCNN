# Interpretable TextCNN
## ECS412: BS Project Work
Phase 1: Scratch Implementation of Linguistically Motivated Features for Classifying Shorter Text
into Fiction and Non-Fiction Genre (https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.77.pdf)

Phase 2: Scratch Implementation of A Fine-Grained Study of Interpretability of Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Classification (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-15471-3_23)

The project aims to implement a novel interpretability framework for text CNNs on linguistically motivated features. The proposed features are borrowed from aforementioned pre-existing work . The exit criterion is to corroborate our interpretability results to the baseline results obtained from the pre-existing work using logistic regression.
